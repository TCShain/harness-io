# Bash Scripts

#### Webhook Loop Script

This script is how you can use a templatized Harness Workflow and Trigger to deploy any amount of Application-specific Services
in any order

EXAMPLE: You want to offer a customer or user a catalogue of available applications or services and want them to select which
ones they want. Their selection will pass an array to this script and then deploy each one out to them as they need.
